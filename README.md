# Text synthesis
<pre>
  <b>Text synthesis</b> refers to the process wherein a machine creates meaningful combinations of words serving 
  a particular purpose. Even though it can be technically termed as 'generation', the real process is about 
  discovering combinations of words that are highly likely to convey <i>meaning</i> to the humans who had created 
  all the texts used in training of a language model.
  
  Texts serving a purpose are <b>speech</b> in a broad sense of the word. These, as philosophers call them - 
  <b>speech acts</b>, can be directed outwards as it is the case with requests, promises, predictions and the 
  like, then they are <b>speech acts</b> per se; or be directed inwards, at the self, the speaker; then it is 
  what philosophers call <b>inner speech</b>; they are <b>speech acts</b> upon self none the less, because they 
  change thoughts.
